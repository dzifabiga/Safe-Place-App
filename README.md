THE PEARL SAFE HAVEN “SAFE PLACE” Application Requirements Document
Purpose of the Mobile Application
The Pearl Safe Haven is determined to change the narrative on gender based violence in Ghana using a multi-prong approach; an approach which comprises building a Safe Haven Mobile Application and Hotline. The app will provide victims or individuals with all information they need to get in touch with the Safe Haven, Stay safe guides, information alerts about activities and events by the Safe Haven, Direct support from the Safe Haven team etc.

The Pearl Safe Haven Overview:
In close collaboration with the Australian High Commission of Ghana (our Patron), we launched The Pearl Safe Haven (a Ghana registered non-profit) on Nov 28, 2018.  Our vision is to promote the basic constitutional human rights of women and children and to protect and heal those who have suffered gender-based violence, nationwide.

The Safe Haven will provide a 24-hour hotline for survivors or persons in the general population to call in for assistance in any area related to domestic violence, abuse, and rape. This hotline will be available before the Safe Haven is fully constructed and would function alongside our “Safe Place” mobile application.

App Functionalities:
The “Safe Place” mobile application is intended to provide women and girls (with smartphones) online resources to discreetly educate them about domestic violence,  how to plan for safety when they decide to remain in the relationship as well as when they decide to leave  abusive environments.

The application will also enable users to send an alert to the hotline when an abuse is threatened or being suffered, which will enable the hotline team to coordinate effectively with the police and other organizations as necessary. 

The ability to obtain data will also enable the Pearl Safe Haven program management team to map out incidences of violence and provide data for analysis to draw up preventative measures and prepare more targeted community outreach programmes. 

The mobile application will enable women and girls to engage with our counsellors and ask for assistance in a secure manner thereby empowering them to break the culture of silence.
